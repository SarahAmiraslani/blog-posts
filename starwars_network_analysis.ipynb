    "# Starwars Network Analysis\n",
    "Given my background in the social sciences, I have found network analysis a very interesting discipline in data science especially as it relates to human social networks. With the evolution of big data, networks have become even more interesitng to study as we can witness them everywhere in our daily lives and can use statistical methods to study them. Studying the structure of a network allows us to answer questions about complex phenomena. Like whether a rumor is likely to spread across the network or who the most influenctial person in an organiation is. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Background\n",
    "A network, or graph, is a representation of connections among a set of items where items are called nodes and the connections are called edges. \n",
    "\n",
    "Data retrived from Kaggle. The JSON can be downloaded from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ruchi798/star-wars.\n",
    "\n",
    "The nodes in this network represent star wars characters and the edges represent conversations between them. Because a conversattion is a two way activity this is an undirected network where the edges have no direction and the relationship between the nodes is symetric. This network is weighted by the number of interactions between the characters, where more interactions corresponds to a stronger connection. \n",
    "\n",
    "This network is undirected as the node"

    "Connectivity \n",

    "- Is the graph strongly connected? A directed graph is strongly connected if, for every pair of nodes u and v there is a directed path from u and v and a directed path from v to u. \n",
    "\n",
    "Distance\n",
    "The distance between two nodes: the length of the shortest path between them. \n",
