If two characters speak together within the same scene, they have been connected. \n\n### Content\n\n- starwars-episode-N-interactions.json contains the social network extracted from Episode N, where the links between characters are defined by the times the characters speak within the same scene.\n\n- starwars-episode-N-mentions.json contains the social network extracted from Episode N, where the links between characters are defined by the times the characters are mentioned within the same scene.\n\n- starwars-episode-N-interactions-allCharacters.json is the interactions network with R2-D2 and Chewbacca added in using data from mentions network.\n\n- starwars-full-... contain the corresponding social networks for the whole set of 6 episodes.\n\nNodes\n- name: Name of the character\n- value: Number of scenes the character appeared in\n- colour: Colour in the visualization\n\nLinks represent connections between characters\n- source: zero-based index of the character that is one end of the link, the order of nodes is the order in which they are listed in the \u201Cnodes\u201D element\n- target: zero-based index of the character that is the the other end of the link.\n- value: Number of scenes where the \u201Csource character\u201D and \u201Ctarget character\u201D of the link appeared together. \n\nThe network is undirected and which character represents the source and the target is arbitrary, they correspond only to two ends of the link.\n"}
